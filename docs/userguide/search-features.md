# Search Features Guide

This guide is being expanded. For now:
- Defaults: parser = `pymupdf4llm`; embeddings provider = `local` (Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B); chunker = `langchain`; hybrid search = enabled; reranker = disabled; summarizer = disabled.
- See the [Quick Start](quick-start.md), [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md), and [Docker Deployment](docker-deployment.md) guides for working configurations.

For immediate help, see:
- [Quick Start Guide](quick-start.md) for basic search setup
- [Troubleshooting Guide](troubleshooting.md) for search quality issues

This guide will include:
- Hybrid search configuration
- Reranking with local and DeepInfra models
- Semantic chunking strategies
- Search optimization techniques
