# Advanced Features Guide

This guide is being expanded. For now:
- Defaults: parser = `pymupdf4llm`; embeddings provider = `local` (Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B); chunker = `langchain`; hybrid search = enabled; reranker = disabled; summarizer = disabled.
- See the [Quick Start](quick-start.md), [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md), and [Docker Deployment](docker-deployment.md) guides for working configurations.

For immediate help, see:
- [Quick Start Guide](quick-start.md) for basic advanced features setup
- [Configuration Guide](configuration.md) for advanced configurations
- [Troubleshooting Guide](troubleshooting.md) for advanced feature issues

This guide will include:
- Document summarization setup (local and remote)
- Enterprise deployment patterns
- Advanced caching strategies
- Custom parser development
- Performance optimization techniques
- Production monitoring and maintenance
