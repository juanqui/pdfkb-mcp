# Embeddings Guide

This guide is being expanded. For now:
- Defaults: parser = `pymupdf4llm`; embeddings provider = `local` (Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B); chunker = `langchain`; hybrid search = enabled; reranker = disabled; summarizer = disabled.
- See the [Quick Start](quick-start.md), [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md), and [Docker Deployment](docker-deployment.md) guides for working configurations.

For immediate help, see:
- [Quick Start Guide](quick-start.md) for DeepInfra embeddings setup
- [Troubleshooting Guide](troubleshooting.md) for embedding issues

This guide will include:
- Local embeddings with Qwen3 models
- OpenAI and OpenAI-compatible API setup
- HuggingFace embeddings configuration
- GGUF quantization options
- Performance comparisons

**Coming soon...**
